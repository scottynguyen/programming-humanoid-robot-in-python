'''In this exercise you need to implement an angle interploation function which makes NAO executes keyframe motion

* Tasks:
    1. complete the code in `AngleInterpolationAgent.angle_interpolation`,
       you are free to use splines interploation or Bezier interploation,
       but the keyframes provided are for Bezier curves, you can simply ignore some data for splines interploation,
       please refer data format below for details.
    2. try different keyframes from `keyframes` folder

* Keyframe data format:
    keyframe := (names, times, keys)
    names := [str, ...]  # list of joint names
    times := [[float, float, ...], [float, float, ...], ...]
    # times is a matrix of floats: Each line corresponding to a joint, and column element to a key.
    keys := [[float, [int, float, float], [int, float, float]], ...]
    # keys is a list of angles in radians or an array of arrays each containing [float angle, Handle1, Handle2],
    # where Handle is [int InterpolationType, float dTime, float dAngle] describing the handle offsets relative
    # to the angle and time of the point. The first Bezier param describes the handle that controls the curve
    # preceding the point, the second describes the curve following the point.

        The following methods rely heavily on some mathematical conjectures
       that we have not proven ourselves. It also conjured up some numerical
       difficulties we had to deal with. We did it that way, because we simply
       could not come up with any closed-formula translation function for the given
       interpolation function time (i.e. the real time axis corresponding to
       the time values as given in the keyframe datapoints) and the convex
       combination parameter t as utilized by the Bezier curve parameterization.
       Hence we had to actually calculate the t value for the given time curTime
       by finding the roots of x-value parameterization of the Bezier curve
       (see the following code and comments).

	   getting t value candidates (solutions for the polynomial) for curTime
